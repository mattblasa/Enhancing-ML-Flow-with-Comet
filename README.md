## About This Project

This is the companion respository for the Heartbeat article <i>Enhancing MLflow with Comet</i>
by Matt Blasa.  

The contents of this repository is example source code demonstrating Comet's machine learning
and experiment tracking used for MLflow machine learning experiments.

## Data 

The data used in this project is taken from the University of Californina Irvine wine quality dataset which can be found here:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine

## Installation

This project is focused for the Azure Databricks environment. 
To run this project, you will need a Databricks to install Comet library to your cluster, 
and upload the project file. 


<b>Installing Libraries</b>

To get started, select the Install New tab in your cluster:

In the Install Library window, select PyPI button. In the package box, type `comet_ml`
If you have a MLflow workflow, I would recommend installing `comet_automl`. Comet_automl
is able to log any existing MLFlow workflow in Databricks.

Import will then take you to the import notebooks popup. Either drop the file or click to upload either `Azure-DB-Comet.py`
or `Azure DB-Comet_Jpyter.ipynb` to the notebook.
